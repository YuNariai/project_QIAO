# project_QIAO
Project Name:
**Apply Random Quantum Neural Network on Noisy Medical Image Recognition**

Team Name:
**QIAO**

Which challenges would you like to submit your project for?
* Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing Challenge
* Quantum computing today!
* NVIDIA Challenge
* Amazon Braket Challenge


Power-Up plan:

* NVIDIA 
Test our circuit on GPU based simulator which might speed up our development.
* AWS 
Try our circuit on real QPU
(Write 1-2 paragraphs for each power up you want to apply for. The idea is to justify why you need this power up in your project. Even if you have obtained a first power up in the coding challenges you are still eligible for any of the new power ups.)
